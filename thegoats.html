        Hi everyone! My name is Juan and I consider myself the glue holding us together.
        The way two individual substances can react and interact in a spontaneous way fascinates me, and that's why I am majoring in Chemical Engineering at the University of Houston.
        I have experience as an EMT, multiple Microsoft applications, and coding.
        I love playing soccer, Netflix, and playing videogames with my friends!

        Hello everyone! I am Rolando and I consider myself to be very hard-working.
        I love engines, so that led me straight to Mechanical Engineering at the University of Houston.
        I have experience with robotics, certified with multiple Microsoft applications, and coding.
        I love being physically active, whether it be jogging or playing soccer, and I love Netflix!

        What's up? My name is Jeswin and I am the primary comedy relief of the group, as well as the loudest one.
        I am majoring in Civil Engineering at the University of Houston because I love working actively outside, hands-on.
        I have experience with drawing all kinds of things, multiple Microsoft applications, and coding.
        In my spare time you can find medrawing, watching TV shows I need to catch up on, playing videogames, or at the gym.
