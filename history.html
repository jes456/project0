We all dreaded it and longed for it at the same time.
Our journey begins with  one individual who determined to make the best out of it with friends and a focused mindset for engineering.
Juan walks up to Jeswin and two others (who have since changed majors), and told them plain and clear, "This school isn't ready for our power.
University of Houston's Cullen College of Engineering has no chance in bringing us down.
</p>

<p>
  We began to study our butts off, but then came the second Chem 1 test.
</p>

<p>
    "We don't stand a chance," Jeswin dreadfully said to his colleagues...
</p>

<p>
  Juan turned and said "Maybe we don't, but we... we have a Frank."
  Frank burst into the room, ready with all the resources we would ever need to succeed. There was an instant realization in Juan and Jeswin's heads, maybe they do have a chance...
</p>

We went on to perform the worst we will ever do in Chem, but it's ok, we had something that was stronger than the chem department's tests. A new friendship.

<p>
Fast forward to our second semester. Juan and I walk into our chem lab and we don't see anyone we recognize
</p>

"Yo bro, don't worry," Juan whispered," I know a guy here."

<p>
  Rolando burst through the door, locked eyes with both of us at the same time, and approached us. What was he gonna do? A high five? Fist bump? My hand-eye coordinition really isn't that goo-
</p>

  A hug. Rolando's calm embrace had confirmed it. The circle was complete.

<p>
  Juan, Rolando, Jeswin, and Frank had done what was done before, but in the best way possible.
</p>

<p>
    We became friends for the work, but destiny knew the greater calling.
