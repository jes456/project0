Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

The following website is about my four good friends in engineering. They are the
smartest people I know and I know I can rely on them for anything. I also know
they can bring the same things to the table at their jobs as well. This website
is essentially an advertisement for the four of us as a group and intends to
show off our ability is best as a group.

index.html is the homepage of the website. The purpose is to set up a proposition
for viewers to peak their interest in what this group of 4 individuals can do.

history.html is how the group met and what we endured as a group and how our
bonds, as well as knowledge has increased greatly over time.

thegots.html hopes to showcase the skills of each individual and the versatility
of the group when they are together.

about.html is the contact info of each of the GOATs.

Each of the .png/.jpg files are pictures of each of the GOATs.

style0.css and style0.scss are used for the primary stylesheets.

style1.css is a secondary stylesheet.
